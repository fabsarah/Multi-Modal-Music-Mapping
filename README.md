# Multi-Modal-Music-Mapping
Code for running HMM, statistical analyses, and figure from Faber et al., 2025

[The link to the pre-print is here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.05.547865v2/)

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need [the PLS toolbox, link here](https://github.com/McIntosh-Lab/PLS) and [the STATIS toolbox, link here](https://github.com/fabsarah/STATIS/wiki/User-Guide)

This repository contains the following:
1. HMM Estimation for the EEG data
2. HMM K tests
3. HMM stability validation
4. Extracting metrics from HMM
5. HMM Estimation for the music feature data
6. HMM K tests and stability validation for the music feature data
7. PLS analyses for all results reported in the paper
8. Code for generating figures as they appear in the paper
