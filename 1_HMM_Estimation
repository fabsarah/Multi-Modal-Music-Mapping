%% Estimating HMM with rest and task data

% The following is code that I wrote for a music listening task with
% healthy adult EEG data. Before starting HMM, data were pre-processed
% (filtered, rereferenced, cleaned, and source localized) in Brainstorm,
% and each trial was added to a trial*participant cell array (in this case,
% 53 possible trials*18 participants). This script will walk through the
% following steps:

%   1. Getting an array of empty values for missing data (this will help
%   later)
%   2. Vectorizing the data matrix
%   3. Initializing the HMM parameters
%   4. Running/saving the HMM analysis
%   5. Selecting a K value

%% 1. Getting the non-empty index for rest and task
%All_Data here is my cell array:
%  (all cells need to be in time*source order...rows are timepoints, columns are ROIs/sources/electrodes)
load('All_Data.mat')

N_nonempty = cell(size(All_Data,2),1);%initialize the output array
for subject = 1:size(N_nonempty,1)%participants
subjectdata = All_Data(:,subject);%get the relevant column
N_nonempty{subject} = find(~cellfun(@isempty,subjectdata));%find the empty cells, add them to the new array
end

clear inmat subject subjectdata %make look nice

%% 2. Vectorizing

data = reshape(All_Data,[],1);%reshape the data
index = cellfun(@isempty, data) == 0;%find the empty cells
data = data(index);%destroy them! (keep only the full cells)
clear index

%% 3. Initializing Parameters
clear T % make sure there isn't another T kicking around
K = 12; % number of states you want
ndim = 68; % number of channels/sources/regions you have
time = 10;% number of timepoints you have per trial
N = 1; % number of trials (my procedure didn't repeat anything, so N=1)
Fs = 512;% sampling rate
T(1:length(data)) = {(Fs*time * ones(N,1))}; % number of data points per song (10 seconds*Fs = 5120)
T = T';%transposing the T vector to match the dimensionality of our data vector

%% 3.1 Setting the initialization parameters
% A lot of the parameterization for HMM is very dependent on the type of data and the type of task
% you have. I have continuous, source-localized EEG data, and these are the parameters I used. The
% HMM-MAR toolbox goes over a lot of these in their wiki, which is very helpful: 
% https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/wiki

clear options % make sure there isn't an old options file in the workspace
options = struct();
options.K = K; 
options.Fs = Fs;
options.covtype = 'full';
options.zeromean = 0;
options.standardise = 1;
options.onpower = 1;% Built-in Hilbert...good for EEG
options.DirichletDiag = 10;% keeps states maximally distinct
options.downsample = 256;% downsample the data (this will also be applied to T - yay!)
options.detrend = 1;% detrending, for slow drifts
options.pca = 0.90;% PCA-ing the data to save time, 90% of variance captured
options.useParallel=1;% if you don't have parallel computing, set this to 0. My condolences, it will take more time
options.verbose = 1;%tells you what's happening
%the following can be toggled to save time, useful when running many estimations:
%options.initrep = 1; % Initialize more quickly
%options.initcyc = 1; % Always choose the first initialization
%options.cyc = 90; % Maximum of  90 cycles

%% 4. Run and save the HMM! 
%This takes several hours and will kick up an error if T and data are not the same size
[hmm, Gamma, Xi, vpath,~,~,~] = hmmmar(data,T,options);

% Sending the output to a structure array
Outdata12.hmm = hmm;
Outdata12.Gamma = Gamma;
Outdata12.vpath = vpath;
filename = '/Users/Desktop/Outdata12.mat';
save(filename, 'Outdata12');

%% 4.1 Populate the structure with our input parameters and region labels
Outdata12.T = T;
Outdata12.options = options;
Outdata12.labs = your_ROI_labels;%put your own label file here
Outdata12.N_nonempty = N_nonempty;% and get the non-empty index - we'll need this for reassembling the matrix into input order later

%% 4.2 Now get a couple of measures for the next step (K validation):

TP = getTransProbs(hmm);% transitional probabilities

FO = zeros(length(T),K);% initialize a matrix for fractional occupancy
FC = cell(K,1);% and for FC

for j = 1:length(T)
    ind = (1:length(T{j}) + (j-1) * length(T{j});%how long your indata was
    FO(j,:) = mean(Gamma(ind,:));% get the Fractional occupancy for each cell
end

for i = 1:K % state FC
    [~,S] = getFuncConn(hmm,i); %get that sweet, sweet correlation matrix
    FC{i} = S; %populate the FC cell
end

Outdata12.Metrics.FO = FO;
Outdata12.Metrics.TP = TP;
Outdata12.Metrics.FC = FC;


% and that's the HMM estimation! The next two script files deal with selecting and validating K. See you there!
