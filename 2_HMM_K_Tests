%% Selecting a suitable K

% Now that the HMM sequence is operational, it's time to run a bunch of HMMs!
% K selection is extremely specific to the data modality, task, air temperature,
% wind direction, and what you had for breakfast, but this script will cover:

%    1. Looking at the transitional probability matrices
%    2. Initial model tests
%    3. Looking at the state properties

% First, you need to have several HMM estimations run with different values
% for K. Run these using the previous script, remembering to rename the Outdata
% file so you don't lose many hours of time and data.

% Next, you'll need to load them all in and assemble them into something that
% is easier to index:

K_tests{1} = Outdata3.Metrics;
K_tests{2} = Outdata4.Metrics;
K_tests{3} = Outdata5.Metrics;
K_tests{4} = Outdata6.Metrics;
K_tests{5} = Outdata7.Metrics;
K_tests{6} = Outdata8.Metrics;
K_tests{7} = Outdata9.Metrics;
K_tests{8} = Outdata10.Metrics;
K_tests{9} = Outdata12.Metrics;
K_tests{10} = Outdata15.Metrics;
K_tests{11} = Outdata20.Metrics;
K_tests{12} = {'K3';'K4';'K5';'K6';'K7';'K8';'K9';'K10';'K12';'K15';'K20'};% a label file of all of the Ks

%% 1. Examining transitional probability matrices:
% In the paper, we did the following:

%      We interrogated the transitional probability matrix from each estimation. The transitional probability 
%      matrix shows the pairwise likelihood of transitioning to and from each state, represented as a weighted, 
%      directed graph. Estimations with states that are over-represented (ie. always transitioned into) or 
%      under-represented (ie. rarely or never visited) can be considered to poorly fit the data. We found the 
%      estimations with a K of 8 and 12 fit the data best with a transitional probability matrix that did not 
%      feature states strongly over- or under-represented. 

% So let's look at some transitional probability matrices!
labels = K_tests{12};

figure
for i = 1:length(K_tests)-1
  tempdata = K_tests{i}.TP;
  %clim([0 1]) % useful to see everything on the same scale
  subplot(3,4,i)
  imagesc(tempdata)
  colorbar
  title(sprintf('TP Matrix: %s',labels{i}),'FontSize',16)

% and now take a look at the estimations. You want a matrix that doesn't have any states that are always or never
% visited. These are the estimations we'll test further. Back to the paper:

%      We further completed initial analyses on these data using PLS, comparing the rest and music listening conditions. 
%      Both estimations returned one significant LV with a p value at or below 0.01 showing the contrast between the 
%      resting state and experiment tasks. Finding both estimations equal up to this point, we interrogated the spatial 
%      properties of the states. Each estimation featured states dominated by temporal regions, a comforting finding in a 
%      music listening study. The estimation with a K of 12 featured bi- and uni-lateral temporal states, while the estimation 
%      with a K of 8 showed exclusively bilateral temporal states.

% For these, you'll need the relevant fractional (FO) metrices:
%get FO
%% Assemble fractional occupancy (FO) into a new object
FO_data{1} = K_tests{1}.FO;
FO_data{2} = K_tests{2}.FO;
FO_data{3} = K_tests{3}.FO;
FO_data{4} = K_tests{4}.FO;
FO_data{5} = K_tests{5}.FO;
FO_data{6} = K_tests{6}.FO;
FO_data{7} = K_tests{7}.FO;
FO_data{8} = K_tests{8}.FO;
FO_data{9} = K_tests{9}.FO;
FO_data{10} = K_tests{10}.FO;
FO_data{11} = K_tests{11}.FO;

%% Appetizer PLS: FO
% now we run a PLS on each FO to see if one estimation gives us more reliable results
% see the Read Me for a link to the Pls toolbox

addpath(genpath('Pls'))
FO_results = cell(length(FO_data),1);

%% Get the task indices
idx_rest = [1:5,46:53];
idx_ctrl = [6:10,41:45];
idx_exp = [11:40];

%% Slice it up
Rest_FO = cell(length(FO_data),1);
Ctrl_FO = cell(length(FO_data),1);
Exp_FO = cell(length(FO_data),1);

for i = 1:length(FO_data)
    Rest_FO{i} = FO_data{i}(idx_rest,:);
    Ctrl_FO{i} = FO_data{i}(idx_ctrl,:);  
    Exp_FO{i} = FO_data{i}(idx_exp,:);
end

clear i idx*

%% Now assemble PLS matrices:

for k = 1:length(FO_results)
    indata = cell(3,1);% 3 tasks (rest, control, and experiment)
    indata{1} = Rest_FO{k};
    indata{2} = Ctrl_FO{k};
    indata{3} = Exp_FO{k}
    indata = cell2mat(indata);
    numsubs = 17;% how many participants per task. If there are different amounts per group, this will be an array
    ncond = 3;% how many conditions/tasks...here, 3 (rest, control, experiment)

    clear i option % make sure there's no old options file hanging around
    option.method = 1;% mean-centred PLS
    option.num_perm = 500;
    option.num_boot = 100;

    K_res = pls_analysis({indata},numsubs,ncond,option);%run the pls
    FO_results{k} = K_res;% put the results into the array
end
clear i k indata numsubs tempdata option K_res n*


%% Assemble and plot p values
ncond = 3;
FO_p = nan(3,length(FO_results));% we will have 1 LV per condition
for k = 1:length(FO_results)
    temp = FO_results{k}.perm_result.sprob;% get the array of p-values
    for LV = 1:ncond
        FO_p(LV,k) = temp(LV);
    end
end
clear k temp LV %make look nice

%%
figure
for LV = 1:ncond
    subplot(ncond,1,LV)
    bar(FO_p(LV,:))
    grid on
    ylim([0 0.1])
    xticklabels(K_tests{12})%the labels we saved earlier
    title(sprintf('PLS p values, FO LV %d',LV))
end
clear LV

% Here, you should hopefully have at least one model with a significant LV. 
% Next, we're going to go look at it:

%% Plot mean-centred PLS results
est = 4;%the estimation you want to plot
res =FO_results{est}; % what results you want to plot
K = size(FO_data{est},2);% the number of states/K for this estimation
LV = 1;% What LV you want to plot
p = res.perm_result.sprob(LV);% the p-value of that LV
headline = sprintf('K Test PLS, p = %f',p);% the title with the p value
xlabs = {'Rest';'Control';'Experiment'};%for example

figure
% The first plot are your contrasts: what conditions are in contrast vs. loading together
subplot(1,2,1)
z = res.boot_result.orig_usc;
limit = length(z);
bar(z(:,LV))
hold on
yneg = res.boot_result.llusc(1:limit,LV);
ypos = res.boot_result.ulusc(1:limit,LV);
errorbar(1:length(z(1:limit,LV)),z(1:limit,LV),yneg-z(1:limit,LV),ypos-z(1:limit,LV),'.')
colorbar off
grid on
xlim([0 length(z)+1])
xticks(1:length(z))
xticklabels(xlabs)
xtickangle(45)
title(headline,'FontSize',16)

% The second plot are your saliences: which state's FO is linked to that effect:
x = (res.boot_result.compare_u(:,LV));
%x(abs(x)<3) = 0;%optional thresholding of the plot
subplot(1,2,2)
imagesc(x);
%colormap(rgb) %optional colormap, included at the bottom of this document

colorbar
xticks([])
yticks(1:K)
yticklabels(1:K)     
ylabel('State')
title(sprintf('Fractional Occupancy LV %d',LV),'FontSize',16)

% to interpret this, you want to line up the cool colour saliences with the negative contrasts, and the warm colour
% saliences with the positive contrasts. NOTE: +/- values here DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN lower or higher FO...it's just
% showing you where the effect is in your input data. There's sample syntax for plotting the indata at the end of this script.

clear res LV p xlabs tasks limit ypos yneg ans x z plotdata headline

%% Now correlate usc and vsc. This will tell us which estimations are similar/dissimilar to each other estimation
LV_corr = nan(1,length(FO_results));
for k = 1:length(FO_results)
    u = FO_results{k}.usc;
    v = FO_results{k}.vsc;
    tempcorr = corrcoef(u,v);
    LV_corr(k) = tempcorr(2,1);
end
clear k tempcorr u v

%%
figure

ylabel('r value')

xticklabels(K_tests{12})
title('USC VSC Correlations, LV1 Variable K')

% By now, one estimation will have hopefully emerged victorious! From here, it's onto testing the optimal K for stability.

%% for posterity, save EVERYTHING:

K_Vars.Estimations = K_tests(1:length(K_tests)-1);%get the indata
K_Vars.Labels = K_tests{12};
K_Vars.FO.FO_data = FO_data;
K_Vars.FO.FO_results = FO_Results

% And if you want to see the input data, sample syntax is here:


%% Plot the FO indata
addpath(genpath('Pls'))
ncond = 3;

est = 4% what indata you want to plot
plotdata = [mean(Rest_FO{est});mean(Ctrl_FO);mean(Exp_FO)];
